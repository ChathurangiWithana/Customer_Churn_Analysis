# Customer_Churn_Analysis

In today's competitive business environment, retaining customers is crucial for long-term success. Churn analysis is a key technique used to understand and reduce this customer attrition. It involves examining customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind customer departures. By using advanced data analytics and machine learning, businesses can predict which customers are at risk of leaving and understand the factors driving their decisions.

## Project Target

Create an entire ETL process in a database & a Power BI dashboard to utilize the Customer Data and achieve below goals:
        
    Visualize & Analyse Customer Data at below levels
    Demographic
    Geographic
    Payment & Account Info
    Services
    Study Churner Profile & Identify Areas for Implementing Marketing Campaigns
    Identify a Method to Predict Future Churners
 

Metrics Required

    Total Customers
    Total Churn & Churn Rate
    New Joiners

## Predict Customer Churn

For predicting customer churn, used Machine Learning algorithm called RANDOM FOREST.

### What is Random Forest?
A random forest is a machine learning algorithm that consists of multiple decision trees. Each decision tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions (in regression tasks) or taking the majority vote (in classification tasks) from all the trees in the forest. This ensemble approach improves the accuracy and robustness of the model by reducing the risk of overfitting compared to using a single decision tree.
